# enrollment-data-quality-project
Enterprise data quality detection and analytics pipeline using Python

Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Python-based data quality validation and cleaning pipeline for simulated enterprise insurance enrollment data. The pipeline identifies and corrects common data integrity issues including missing values, duplicate records, invalid dates, and premium inconsistencies.

Tools

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Methods

Data generation and simulation
Automated validation rules
Data cleaning and transformation
Visual analytics

Results

The project highlights enterprise data governance techniques and demonstrates how automated pipelines can improve data integrity for downstream analytics and machine learning applications. 

Future Work

Future extensions include building a machine learning model to predict enrollment errors and deploying the pipeline as a cloud-based data validation service.
